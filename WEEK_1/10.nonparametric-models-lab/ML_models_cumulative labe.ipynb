    "\n",
    "* Practice identifying and applying appropriate preprocessing steps\n",
    "* Perform an iterative modeling process, starting from a baseline model\n",
    "* Explore multiple model algorithms, and tune their hyperparameters\n",

    "\n",
    "Although you may be aware of some additional model algorithms available from scikit-learn, for this lab you will be focusing on two of them: k-nearest neighbors and decision trees. Here are some reminders about these models:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### kNN - [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm — unlike linear models or tree-based models — does not emphasize learning the relationship between the features and the target. Instead, for a given test record, it finds the most similar records in the training set and returns an average of their target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training speed:** Fast. In theory it's just saving the training data for later, although the scikit-learn implementation has some additional logic \"under the hood\" to make prediction faster.\n",
    "* **Prediction speed:** Very slow. The model has to look at every record in the training set to find the k closest to the new record.\n",
    "* **Requires scaling:** Yes. The algorithm to find the nearest records is distance-based, so it matters that distances are all on the same scale.\n",
    "* **Key hyperparameters:** `n_neighbors` (how many nearest neighbors to find; too few neighbors leads to overfitting, too many leads to underfitting), `p` and `metric` (what kind of distance to use in defining \"nearest\" neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees - [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to linear models (and unlike kNN), this algorithm emphasizes learning the relationship between the features and the target. However, unlike a linear model that tries to find linear relationships between each of the features and the target, decision trees look for ways to split the data based on features to decrease the entropy of the target in each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training speed:** Slow. The model is considering splits based on as many as all of the available features, and it can split on the same feature multiple times. This requires exponential computational time that increases based on the number of columns as well as the number of rows.\n",
    "* **Prediction speed:** Medium fast. Producing a prediction with a decision tree means applying several conditional statements, which is slower than something like logistic regression but faster than kNN.\n",
    "* **Requires scaling:** No. This model is not distance-based. You also can use a `LabelEncoder` rather than `OneHotEncoder` for categorical data, since this algorithm doesn't necessarily assume that the distance between `1` and `2` is the same as the distance between `2` and `3`.\n",
    "* **Key hyperparameters:** Many features relating to \"pruning\" the tree. By default they are set so the tree can overfit, and by setting them higher or lower (depending on the hyperparameter) you can reduce overfitting, but too much will lead to underfitting. These are: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `min_weight_fraction_leaf`, `max_features`, `max_leaf_nodes`, and `min_impurity_decrease`. You can also try changing the `criterion` to \"entropy\" or the `splitter` to \"random\" if you want to change the splitting logic."

    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Decision Tree**: \n",
    "   - **Log Loss**: 0.7365  \n",
    "   - **Analysis**: The baseline model severely overfits, as it grows too deep and memorizes training data, leading to poor generalization.\n",

    "2. **Model 1** (limit tree depth to 10):  \n",
    "   - **Log Loss**: 0.3488  \n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Limiting the tree depth helps mitigate overfitting, reducing the log loss by over 50%. However, the model might still overfit smaller splits or leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model 2** (increase `min_samples_split` to 20):  \n",
    "   - **Log Loss**: 0.2375  \n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Adding a constraint on the minimum number of samples required to split a node prevents overly specific splits, further improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model 3** (increase `min_samples_leaf` to 10):  \n",
    "   - **Log Loss**: 0.2041  \n",
    "   - **Analysis**: Requiring a minimum number of samples per leaf reduces overfitting even more, creating a model that generalizes better. This is the best decision tree model so far.\n",

    "### **Interpretation of Model Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log Loss**:  \n",
    "   The log loss of **0.0719** indicates that the model's predicted probabilities are highly confident and accurate for the correct class. A lower log loss reflects better-calibrated probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy**:  \n",
    "   The accuracy of **98.05%** shows that the model correctly classifies a vast majority of instances in the test set. However, for imbalanced datasets like this, accuracy alone can be misleading as it may favor the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Precision**:  \n",
    "   The precision of **91.79%** indicates that when the model predicts the minority class (`Cover_Type = 1`), it is correct about **91.79%** of the time. This is important for tasks where false positives need to be minimized, such as identifying rare species with high confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recall**:  \n",
    "   The recall of **79.77%** shows that the model identifies nearly 80% of the minority class instances. This is crucial for tasks where missing true positives is costly, such as conservation efforts or environmental monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison to Baseline Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dummy Model**:\n",
    "   - A dummy model that always predicts the majority class (e.g., `Cover_Type = 0`) would have a high accuracy (e.g., ~95%) but a poor recall (0%) for the minority class. In contrast, this model achieves both **high accuracy** and a **balanced precision-recall tradeoff**, making it significantly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - The baseline logistic regression model had a log loss of **0.1303** compared to this model's **0.0719**, a significant improvement. Logistic regression assumes linear relationships, which likely limits its performance on this nonlinear dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task Suitability**\n",
    "- **Strengths**:  \n",
    "   This model performs exceptionally well for tasks requiring both accurate classification and well-calibrated probabilities, such as species classification, ecological surveys, or conservation monitoring.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Limitations**:  \n",
    "   The slightly lower recall (~80%) could be a drawback for tasks where identifying all instances of the minority class is critical, such as early detection of invasive species."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you practiced the end-to-end machine learning process with multiple model algorithms, including tuning the hyperparameters for those different algorithms. You saw how nonparametric models can be more flexible than linear models, potentially leading to overfitting but also potentially reducing underfitting by being able to learn non-linear relationships between variables. You also likely saw how there can be a tradeoff between speed and performance, with good metrics correlating with slow speeds."
